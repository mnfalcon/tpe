Special work by special people

The most important features of this project are the dynamic table and the SPA functionality created with JavaScript. I made it for one my college courses,
which is why some things are written in Spanish.

## About the dynamic table
Features:
- Pagination
- 3 filters that work simultaneosly with the data loaded in the DOM
- 1 filter that highlights the rows that meet the criteria (the criteria is if the number is greater than an input number)
- Downloading the data from an API and uploading new data to it
